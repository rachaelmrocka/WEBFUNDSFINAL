	<h1><b>Artistry</b></h1>

		<p> 

		<b> Influences</b> Gaga grew up listening to artists such as the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, the Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Blondie and Garbage, who have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers such as Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater. She has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga.Gaga says that she wants to revolutionize pop music as Madonna has.Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, including Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath. She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.

		<p> Gaga was inspired by her mother to be interested in fashion, which she now says is a major influence and integrated with her music. Stylistically, Gaga has been compared to Leigh Bowery, Isabella Blow, and Cher;the once commented that as a child, she absorbed Cher's fashion sense and made it her own.[227] She considers Donatella Versace her muse and the English fashion designer Alexander McQueen as an inspiration. In turn, Versace calls Lady Gaga "the fresh Donatella". Gaga has also been influenced by Princess Diana, whom she has admired since her childhood.

		Gaga has called the Indian alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra a "true inspiration",and has also quoted Indian leader Osho's book Creativity on Twitter. Gaga says she was influenced by Osho's work in valuing rebellion through creativity and equality.

	<h2><b>What Is She Doing Now?</b></h2> 
	

	<p> Lady Gagas house in Malibu is on a relatively nondescript road just off the Pacific Coast Highway, situated in what feels (for Malibu) like a normal suburban neighborhood. When the gates to her compound swing open you head down a long gravel driveway that threads through the multi-acre property past the fenced in ring where she rides her horse Arabella past the barns and the stables and the giant barking dogs, Grandpa and Ronnie and pull up to a house made of fieldstone that looks at first glance as if it belongs in the South of France. A cheerful young fellow greets you at your car explains that he is the head of security and asks you to sign an NDA. There are at least a dozen other cars parked around, most of them belonging to people who are doing some kind of work here taking care of the property or the lady in residence in one capacity or another. The whole setup is both grand and yet somehow unassuming (for a rock stars house in Malibu). </p> <p> When Gaga comes down the stairs and makes her entrance on this hot do nothing August afternoon she is wearing a diaphanous periwinkle robe with ruffled edges that sweeps the floor nothing underneath but a matching bra and thong along with nude kitten heels and Liz Taylor worthy diamond jewelry. Having just returned yesterday from a long restful vacation on some remote tropical island with her boyfriend she is uncharacteristically tan and as she leads me out through the French doors into the garden I can see nearly every one of her tattoos and her shapely behind through the robe. There are roses trembling in the breeze and a long sloping grassy lawn that leads down to a pool and the Pacific Ocean beyond flickering in the high afternoon sun. This is my sanctuary she says. My oasis of peace. I call it my gypsy palace.</p> <p> She bought this palace about four years ago when she was going through a rough patch both physically and mentally and has been spending more and more time here lately. I just got rid of my place in New York it was too hectic every day outside on the street she says. She says
		<blockquote> <p> I would go back to my apartment everyday and I would just sit there. It was quiet and it was lonely. It was still. It was just my piano and myself. I had a televeision and I would leave it on all the time just to feel like somebody was hanging out with me.</p></blockquote> As we stand there looking out at the ocean I ask if shes happy. Yes Im focusing on the things that I believe in. Im challenging myself. Im embarking on new territory with some nerves and some overjoyment. (Gaga has a funny habit of making up words that always make perfect sense.) Its an interesting time in my life. Its a transition for sure. Its been a decade. <p> In April, Gaga noted on her Instagram that it was the tenth anniversary of her first single Just Dance. It was the song of the summer of 2008 the final hours of the golden years just before the economy imploded and the Great Recession took hold and almost immediately she became the biggest pop star in the world haunting our dreams and nightmares with monsters meat dresses and some of the stickiest melodies ever written. In discussion about her eye catching fashions and aesthetically pleasing energy Gaga says <blockquote><p> Im not a supermodel. Thats not what I do. What I do is music. I want my fans to feel the way I do, to know what they have to offer is just as important. More important. What they are feeling is more important than whats happening on the outside. </p></blockquote> </p> When I ask her what has changed for her over these last ten years Gaga whos 32 says a galaxy and laughs. There has been a galaxy of change. She pauses for a moment. I would just say that its been a nonstop whirlwind. And when I am in an imaginative or creative mode it sort of grabs me like a sleigh with a thousand horses and pulls me away and I just don’t stop working. Another pause. You...make friends you lose friends you build tighter bonds with people youve known for your whole life. But there’s a lot of emotional pain and you cant really understand what it all means until ten years has gone by.</p> <p>On October 5, Warner Bros. Pictures will release the fourth iteration of the tragi-musical love story <a href="/article/lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-a-star-is-born-trailer"><em>A Star Is Born</em>, starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga</a>. The first version came out in 1937 starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March followed by Judy Garland and James Mason in 1954 and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in 1976. Gaga thinks of it less as a remake than as a traveling legacy. Directed by Cooper in his debut the film is remarkably assured deeply engaging and works on several levels: as a romance a drama a musical and something else entirely almost as if youre watching something live or documentary footage of a good old fashioned rock n roll concert movie. I wanted to tell a love story says Cooper and to me theres no better way than through music. With music its impossible to hide. Every fiber of your body becomes alive when you sing. As Sean Penn said after seeing the film more than once its the best most important commercial film I’e seen in so many years and he described the stars as miracles. Cooper and Gaga and the film itself are likely to be nominated for all manner of awards.
